# CPR DPANN RuBisCO

Code and intermediate data files supporting "Lateral gene transfer shapes the distribution of RuBisCO among Candidate Phyla Radiation bacteria and DPANN archaea" (Jaffe et al., 2018).

## code

Code describing the main analyses and figure generation are available here in Jupyter Notebook format.

## data

RuBisCO sequences from the main analysis are available here (/data/rubisco_final.drep99.wrefs.faa) in addition to various intermediate files used in the Jupyter Notebook. Genomes utilized in the pathway analyses will be available on NCBI (TBA).

## trees and alignments

Raw versions of the RuBisCO, deoA, e2b2, PRK, and FBP/SBPase trees used in the paper's figures are available here in /trees/.

The alignments used to generate the paper's main RuBisCO tree is available here in /alignments/.
