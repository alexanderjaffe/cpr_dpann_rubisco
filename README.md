# CPR DPANN RuBisCO

Code and intermediate data files supporting "Lateral gene transfer shapes the distribution of RuBisCO among Candidate Phyla Radiation bacteria and DPANN archaea" (Jaffe et al., 2018).

## code

Code describing the main analyses and figure generation are available here in Jupyter Notebook format.

## data

RuBisCO sequences from the main analysis are available here (/data/rubisco_final.drep99.wrefs.faa) in addition to various intermediate files used in the Jupyter Notebook. Newly reported sequences from this study, including those from the pathway analyses, are available at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at the following accession number: PRJEB29721.

N.B. The sequence set has changed slightly since the pre-print stage, please contact if any questions.

## trees and alignments

Raw versions of the RuBisCO, deoA, e2b2, PRK, and FBP/SBPase trees used in the paper's figures are available here in /trees/.

The unmasked version of the alignment used to generate the paper's main RuBisCO tree is available here in /alignments/.
